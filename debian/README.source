Chez Scheme for Debian
----------------------

Upstream's corporate logo was removed due to non-DFSG conditions.
Additionally the file examples/rsa.ss was removed since there was no
explicit license.

Building the first time is not straightforward due to semi-circular
dependencies. Build in this order:

* Build and install nanopass-framework-scheme with
  DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck DEB_BUILD_PROFILES=nocheck.

* Build chezscheme with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS="nodoc nocheck"
  DEB_BUILD_PROFILES="nodoc nocheck" and install the built packages.

* Build and install stex.

* Build chezscheme again to build everything, including documentation.

Once stex and nanopass are in the archive then it is from that point
possible to build as usual.
